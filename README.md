# Image-Recorgnition-Using-LabVIEW
Today we are surrounded by different technologies which are constantly developing. We are in an era of technological renaissance. With an increase in the technology we develop we are moving towards a world where everything is integrated and connected seamlessly.  

Today to facilitate seamless adaption of technology across different domains of science, there has been development in various fields of science in many different areas like Neural Networks, Statistical Methods, Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computation and different areas of Physics.  The Phase-2 of the project is intended to implement a highly dynamic field of study i.e. Image Classification and Identification used almost everywhere in Industry to classify materials based on their quality, using a highly interactive G-Programming Environment taught under the curriculum i.e. NI-LabVIEW.   

The projecct explains how the IEEE 802.11 and SMTP Protocols are used by cameras to transfer our images and analyse them.
